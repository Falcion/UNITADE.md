<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT:

## About the project

Unfortunately, Obsidian does not, for some reason, have the ability to edit any file extensions that the user would like to edit, and the plugins that exist for this application are an inconvenient format for the end user, for example, entering a full-fledged JSON in one line.

Plugin UNITADE presents a simple yet advanced and user-friendly solution of this file extension problem: you can not only open and registry any extension in OBSIDIAN, but also, force-open them in your vault, render them as code just like in other code editing software (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for example) and many other infrastructure and functionalities, including compatibility modules for stale versions of plugin.

> This project has custom brandbook (guidelines) and license for it's media (logo and etc.).\

2. If you have installed plugin and app saw it, you can see element named "UNITADE": open it and seek for setting named “extensions” and type an array of extensions, separated by "greater-than sign" (`>`);
