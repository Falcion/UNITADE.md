<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT:
 -->

About the project
-----------------

Unfortunately, Obsidian™ does not, for some reason, have the ability to edit any file extensions that the user would like to edit, and the plugins that exist for this application are an inconvenient format for the end user, for example, entering a full-fledged JSON in one line.

Plugin UNITADE presents a simple, user-friendly solution of this file extension problem: you can not only open and registry any extension in OBSIDIAN, but also, force-open them in your vault.
