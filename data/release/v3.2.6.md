# v3.2.6 - UNITADE's patch release

This patch fixes problems with two systems: applying and unapplying systems
which were updated after previous (v3.2.5) update:

> [!Note]
> This patch is a must-have because it fixes primary issues with using code editor and
> default extensions systems at the same time: if you use grouped extensions, patch of
> this won't affect your performance or working pipeline.

- previously, apply system was "one-directional", meaning when it tried to apply
  one of the extensions modes, it would ignore one, which was a big oversee in the system,
  for more info, see #137.
- accordingly to update of applying system, unapplying system was also fixed: now it asks
  for real-time value of markdown overcharge and unapplies every registry of extension in
  the plugin, for more info and fix, see #139.
