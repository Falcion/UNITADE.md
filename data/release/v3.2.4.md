# v3.2.4 for UNITADE

This release introduces a set of targeted internal improvements addressing long-standing integration inconsistencies in the code editor system and refines error-handling mechanisms across the application. Two previously open issues, #119 and #126, were directly resolved, tightening the communication between components that rely on Monaco editor workers and the observer mechanisms. These fixes reduce noisy runtime interruptions, leading to more predictable system behavior.

More significantly, a new capability has been introduced for advanced users: error "silencing" based on message signature recognition. This allows selective suppression of known benign errors without affecting critical flows. The feature is meant to reduce clutter in both development and production environments, especially in plugin-heavy or sandboxed contexts. Documentation and implementation patterns are available in the wiki.

In effect, this patch lays groundwork for more reliable debugging and improved maintainability, shaving off technical debt while offering power-users deeper control.
