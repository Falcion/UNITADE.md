# v3.2.5 of UNITADE

1) fixed issues with code editor settings not hiding it's settings when disabled upon start of plugin;
2) fixed issues with code editor settings not hiding their approriate headings (e.c. "font" settings);
3) redistributed the system of loading and unloading all things related to UNITADE (view, extensions, modules);
4) fixed the problem with updating the Onload/Onload-unsafe functions - now they update the settings page;
5) fixed ticket #135, now code editor extensions are unlinked in terms of logic with vanilla extensions, previously, they were overwriting any external logic (if, for example, code editor itself was disabled).
6) fixed multiple copy+paste issues within UNITADE:
   1) #116 ("Double pasting in regular files with unitade enabled")
   2) #131 ("UNITADE cannot paste content copied from other notes")
   3) #132 ("double-paste from outside sources on code editor files")
