The official GitHub CLI now includes functionality that allows you to clone labels easily from one repo to another.

Example syntax:
`gh label clone org-name/repo-to-clone-from --repo org-name/repo-to-clone-to`
See docs for the info:
- https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_label_clone
The GitHub CLI docs also illustrate listing the labels using custom JSON output templates:
